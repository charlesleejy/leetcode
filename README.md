### Data Structures

Arrays and Strings
* Arrays store elements in a contiguous block of memory, allowing for index-based access.
* Strings are arrays of characters and are commonly used in problems involving pattern recognition, parsing, or transformations.

Linked Lists
* A sequence of nodes where each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. Problems often involve operations like reversal, merging, and cycle detection.

Hash Tables
* Store key-value pairs and provide efficient retrieval based on keys. Common uses include counting frequencies of objects, finding duplicates, or tracking seen values.

Stacks and Queues
* Stacks are used for depth-first search, syntax parsing, and backtracking problems.
* Queues are essential for breadth-first search and can be implemented using deques for efficiency.

Trees and Graphs
* Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), N-ary Trees, and Tries are common tree structures.
* Graphs are used in problems involving networks of nodes and edges, requiring algorithms like BFS and DFS.

Heaps (Priority Queues)
* Provide efficient access to the minimum or maximum element. Useful in problems involving sorting, median finding, or managing priority tasks.

Other Structures
* Disjoint Set (Union-Find) for group/component tracking and union-find operations.
* Graphs (Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted) for representing connections and relationships.


### Algorithms

Sorting Algorithms
* Including quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort, these are fundamental for organizing data before applying further algorithms.

Search Algorithms
* Binary Search for efficiently finding an item in sorted data.
* DFS and BFS for traversing trees and graphs.

Dynamic Programming
* Solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems using memorization or tabulation.

Recursion
* A method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

Greedy Algorithms
* Making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

Graph Algorithms
* Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford algorithms for shortest paths.
* Floyd-Warshall for all pairs shortest paths.
* Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for minimum spanning trees.

Bit Manipulation
* Useful for low-level data manipulation and optimization, often seen in problems involving flags, masks, and encodings.


### Problem-Solving Techniques

Divide and Conquer
* A technique for dividing the problem into smaller parts, solving them independently, and combining their results.

Backtracking
* A method for finding all (or some) solutions by exploring possible candidate solutions incrementally and abandoning each partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that this candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Sliding Window
* Often used in array/string problems where a subset of data is processed continuously to either find a condition that is met or compute some result.
